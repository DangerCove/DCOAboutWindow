# Overview

DCOAboutWindow is a replacement for the standard About dialog.

It adds the option to open acknowledgments and visit the website by clicking a button.

![DCOAboutWindow in action](https://raw.github.com/DangerCove/DCOAboutWindow/master/screenshots/DCOAboutWindow.jpg)

## Showing acknowledgments

You can point to and maintain a custom `Acknowledgments.rtf` file, or you can use a script like [Acknowledge](https://github.com/DangerCove/Acknowledge) to generate it for you.

# Setup

## Via [cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org)

Add the following line to your Podfile:

    pod 'DCOAboutWindow'

Then run `pod install` and you're set.

## Manually

Clone this repo and add files from `DCOAboutWindow` to your project.

The project relies on [DCOTransparentScroller](https://github.com/DangerCove/DCOTransparentScroller), so include that too.

# Usage

I've made a [sample project](https://github.com/DangerCove/DCOAboutWindowExample) that accompanies this tiny guide.

Import `DCOAboutWindowController`:

    #import <DCOAboutWindow/DCOAboutWindowController.h>

Instantiate `DCOAboutWindow`:

    // Note: make sure self.aboutWindowController is retained
    self.aboutWindowController = [[DCOAboutWindowController alloc] init];

Create an IBAction to display the window:

    - (IBAction)showAboutWindow:(id)sender {
      [self.aboutWindowController showWindow:nil];
    }

Hook it up to the 'About [app name]' menu item or a button.

You can change values by setting properties on `DCOAboutWindowController`:

    /**
     *  The application name.
     *  Default: CFBundleName
     */
    @property (copy) NSString *appName;

    /**
     *  The application version.
     *  Default: "Version %@ (Build %@)", CFBundleVersion, CFBundleShortVersionString
     */
    @property (copy) NSString *appVersion;

    /**
     *  The copyright line.
     *  Default: NSHumanReadableCopyright
     */
    @property (copy) NSString *appCopyright;

    /**
     *  The credits.
     *  Default: [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Credits" ofType:@"rtf"];
     */
    @property (copy) NSAttributedString *appCredits;

    /**
     *  The URL pointing to the app's website.
     *  Default: none
     */
    @property (strong) NSURL *appWebsiteURL;

    /**
     *  The path to the file that contains the acknowledgments.
     *  Default: [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Acknowledgments" ofType:@"rtf"];
     */
    @property (nonatomic, copy) NSString *acknowledgmentsPath;

    /**
     *  If set to YES acknowledgments are shown in a text view, inside the window. Otherwise an external editor is launched.
     *  Default: NO;
     */
    @property (assign) BOOL useTextViewForAcknowledgments;

## Pre-processing (for Dark Mode)

You can pre-process the `NSAttributedString` containing the app credits using a delegate. This is great for making the about window play nice with Mojave's Dark Mode. Here's how it works:

    // Conform to the DCOStringPreprocessingProtocol
    @interface DCDAppDelegate() <DCOStringPreprocessingProtocol>
    
    self.aboutWindowController = [[DCOAboutWindowController alloc] init];
    // Set the delegate
    self.aboutWindowController.delegate = self;

    #pragma mark - DCOStringPreprocessingProtocol
    
    - (NSAttributedString *)preproccessAppCredits:(NSAttributedString *)appCredits {
        NSMutableAttributedString *mutableCredits = [appCredits mutableCopy];
        
        NSDictionary *attributes = @{ NSForegroundColorAttributeName : [NSColor textColor] };
        [mutableCredits setAttributes:attributes range:NSMakeRange(0, mutableCredits.length)];
        
        return [mutableCredits copy];
    }

    // Optionally pre-process the acknowledgments as well
    - (NSAttributedString *)preproccessAppAcknowledgments:(NSAttributedString *)appAcknowledgments {
        NSMutableAttributedString *mutableAcknowledgments = [appAcknowledgments mutableCopy];
        
        NSDictionary *attributes = @{ NSForegroundColorAttributeName : [NSColor textColor] };
        [mutableAcknowledgments setAttributes:attributes range:NSMakeRange(0, mutableCredits.length)];
        
        return [mutableAcknowledgments copy];
    }

Thanks to [@balthisar](https://github.com/balthisar) for adding this.

# Localization

Add the following lines to your Localizable.string to change these values, or localize them.

    /* Version %@ (Build %@), displayed in the about window */
    "Version %@ (Build %@)" = "v%@ (%@)";

    /* Caption on the 'Visit the %@ Website' button in the about window */
    "Visit the %@ Website" = "Visit %@'s Website";

    /* Caption of the 'Acknowledgments' button in the about window */
    "Acknowledgments" = "Acknowledgments";

    /* Caption of the 'Credits' button in the about window when acknowledgments are shown when useTextViewForAcknowledgments is YES. */
    "Credits" = "Credits";

# Contributions and things to add

Be creative. DCOAboutWindow should be a flexible, easy to use way to make the About Window for your app look pretty. Make sure your changes don't break existing functionality without good reason.

# Changelog

## v0.2.0

* Optionally display acknowledgments inside the window, instead of through an external editor.

Set `useTextViewForAcknowledgments` to `YES` to enable this feature.

* Improve Auto Layout constrains. The image view now remains the same width, while the text fields can become wider.

## v0.1.0

* Improved localization support
* Improved auto-layout constraints to handle resizing better

You can toggle (off by default) resizing by setting the `NSWindow`'s `styleMask`. Check out the [example project](https://github.com/DangerCove/DCOAboutWindowExample) to see how this works.

## v0.0.2

* Switched to using 'Acknowledgments' instead of 'Acknowledg_e_ments' to be more consistent and prevent incompatibility with [Acknowledge](https://github.com/DangerCove/Acknowledge). **NOTE:** Make sure you change the filename of your acknowledgments and any setters/getters.

## v0.0.1

* Initial release.
